{"executive_summary": "RuleConfigurationPage.py enables automated testing of rule creation, triggers, conditions, actions, validation, saving, retrieving, and persistence verification in the Automated Transfers interface, strictly using provided locators.", "detailed_analysis": "The PageClass is designed to cover all test steps in TC-SCRUM-158-001 and TC-SCRUM-158-002. It exposes methods for each UI element involved in rule configuration, trigger setup, condition definition, action specification, schema validation, rule saving, retrieval, and verification. Locators are strictly mapped as per input. Methods use explicit waits and input sanitization. The code is ready for integration with downstream test cases and pipelines.", "implementation_guide": "1. Import RuleConfigurationPage.py into your test suite. 2. Instantiate with a Selenium WebDriver. 3. Use methods to perform rule creation, trigger setup, condition and action specification, validation, saving, and verification. 4. Chain calls as per test steps. 5. Use the documentation for reference.", "qa_report": "- Code integrity verified.\n- Locators strictly mapped.\n- Explicit waits used to prevent flakiness.\n- Input sanitization applied.\n- No external dependencies beyond Selenium.\n- Ready for downstream automation.\n- Methods cover all acceptance criteria in test cases.", "troubleshooting_guide": "- If element not found: Check locator accuracy and page load timing.\n- If validation fails: Ensure schema text is correct and editor is focused.\n- If rule retrieval fails: Confirm rule ID format and input method.\n- If actions not executed: Check account data and UI state.", "future_considerations": "- Add advanced verification for rule components.\n- Integrate with database checks for persistence.\n- Expand for negative test cases.\n- Parameterize for multi-role testing.\n- Add logging and reporting hooks."}
