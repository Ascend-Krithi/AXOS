{"executive_summary": "RuleConfigurationPage.py has been updated to support TC_SCRUM158_05 (unsupported trigger type error handling) and TC_SCRUM158_06 (maximum allowed conditions/actions validation). New methods strictly preserve existing logic and append robust error handling and UI validation. Locators are referenced from RuleConfigurationPage.py.locators.json. Code is ready for downstream automation.", "quality_assurance": "All updates maintain strict code integrity. Existing methods are untouched, new methods are appended at the end of the class. Locators are referenced as per RuleConfigurationPage.py.locators.json. Each method includes docstrings. UI waits are used for reliability. Maximum conditions/actions are parameterized for easy adjustment.", "troubleshooting_guide": "If test fails, verify locators match UI, ensure correct test data is passed, and confirm that maximum allowed conditions/actions are set as per business logic. For unsupported trigger type, ensure UI correctly rejects unsupported types and displays error.", "future_considerations": "Consider parameterizing locators for flexibility, implement error handling for UI interaction failures, and expand backend retrieval logic for validation. If maximums change, update max_conditions/max_actions parameters accordingly."}
